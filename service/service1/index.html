<p>If you have been injured in an accident or on the job, the obstacles to your recovery may seem overwhelming. Please contact me if you have had an auto accident, slip and fall or an on-the-job injury, and we can discuss your options.</p>
<p>In addition to helping people with current situations, I help people plan for the future. Protecting your property and ensuring that your wishes are carried out is something that none of us should leave to chance. Protecting yourself now can preserve what you have earned for your loved ones. Let my experience of protecting assets and minimizing taxes through estate planning give you the comfort of knowing that all for which you have worked will not be wasted. I am also very experienced in handling probate administration of estates of deceased persons. I am prompt, thorough and sensitive to the emotions of clients that have lost a loved one.</p>
<p>My practice areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Injury - Plaintiff:</strong> Personal Injury falls under Tort Law. Personal Injury involves civil law cases where you are trying to obtain compensation for an injury you sustained to your person. Personal injuries can be physical or psychological. Before you can collect an award, your personal injury lawyer will have to prove that the defendant is liable by establishing negligence.</li>
<li><strong>Probate and Estate Administration:</strong> When a person dies, his or her estate must go through probate. If the decedent leaves a will directing how his or her property should be distributed after death, the court must determine if it should be admitted to probate and given legal effect. If the decedent dies without leaving a will, the court appoints a Personal Representative to distribute the decedent’s property according to the laws of Decent and Distribution. These laws direct the distribution of assets based on hereditary succession.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Real estate transactions are governed by federal statutes, as well as state statutory and common law. Real Estate Law encompasses these statutes and laws, as well as property law matters. Real estate law includes a wide variety of legal issues relating to acquiring, financing, developing, managing, constructing, leasing and selling commercial and residential real property of all kinds.</li>
<li><strong>Workers&rsquo; Compensation:</strong> Workers’ compensation laws are designed to ensure payment by employers for some part of the cost of injuries, or in some cases of occupational diseases, received by employees in the course of their work.</li>
<li><strong>Estate Planning / Elder Law:</strong> Preparing estate plans, wills, trusts, powers of attorney (both financial and medical), living wills, transfer-on-death deeds, and related documents.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am licensed to practice in Ohio and Florida. If you are contemplating a real estate deal to get out of these northern winters, or you would like estate planning or probate services that encompass assets in both states, I can help. Many of my clients find it convenient that I can administer Florida estates, file documents with the courts of Florida, execute Florida wills and trusts, and provide Florida real estate services from my desk in Mayfield Village. Whether you are getting ready to retire, already retired, or just staying out of the cold, you do not need different attorneys for different seasons. You can have all of your legal needs handled in one place.</p>
<p>I am also a member of the AARP Legal Services Network, screened by AARP to meet AARP standards of experience and customer service. I am a member of the Cleveland Bar Association, the Cuyahoga County Bar Association, the Florida Bar, and the Collier County, Florida Bar Association.</p>
